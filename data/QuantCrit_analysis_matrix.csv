in geography. Its two primary arguments are that race should be more central in the discipline and that a
reluctance to address ontological and epistemological issues has left quantitative geography methodologically
impoverished. These two issues merge in an examination of two cases where race is employed as a variable in
quantitative models. The critique of these cases is not meant as a condemnation of quantitative geography but
as an instructive example on which to construct a critical quantitative geography. The article ends by stressing
the importance of quantification in geography and by presenting exemplars of race-critical quantification.",Goes into critical quant geography,n/a,"Author talks about the importance of reflexivity and cites Lawson 1995 ""Quantitative
geographers who do not acknowledge ontology
and epistemology’s role in shaping methodology
tend to be insensitive to the power
relationships embedded within data and tend
not to see their subjects as people inhabiting a
world shaped by cultural, political, and social
conventions (Lawson 1995). When researchers
view their subjects as merely the data points on
which they employ their techniques, they are
being unreflexive about how their subjects are
constructed within their models and about how
their models can work to re-reify sociocultural
categories rather than enlightening the
complex human and institutional relationships
that produce these categories""","In short, the goal of quantitative geography
is to process spatial data for mathematical and
statistical analysis. But what is the genealogy
of these data? When comparing qualitative
geography methods texts to quantitative
geography methods texts, one of the most
striking differences between the two is how
many pages in qualitative texts are devoted to
data collection and processing (interviewing,
focus groups, participant observation, coding,
etc.) and how few are given over to these
pursuits in quantitative texts",Brings up term race-critical quantification,,The Professional Geographer

While the ACS has been collecting data for more than a decade, the first census tract results were released in 2010. The ACS collects its data based on a rolling sample. It is purported to have many advantages over the Decennial Census, including frequently updated data, less overall cost, and better coverage. We have found, however, that the ACS can produce
highly inaccurate data, in part because of reliance on extremely small samples in sparsely populated neighborhoods.We explore these dynamics through a community survey which replicates ACS questions while employing the old Decennial Census long form sampling strategy of requesting information from one in six households in a single inner city census tract in Nashville, Tennessee. Our results show that the ACS has grossly underestimated the total population and the number of people living in poverty in the
neighborhood, among other variables of interest. Through an examination of the number of census tracts with very small sample sizes and a comparison of recent ACS results with the 2010 Decennial Census, we show that the problems identified in this single tract occur throughout the country. In addition, we consider how statistical profiles of neighborhoods derived from the ACS and other data sources enable wide ranges of action in those neighborhoods, action which can be harmful given inaccurate and/or decontextualized data.",,"ACS data and compared with authors' own ""grounded knowledge"" doing a community survey in Chestnut Hill, Nashville TN.

Although smart technologies can further orthodox positivist approaches, we argue that the actual practice is more nuanced and not necessarily absolute or totalizing. For example, recent computational work builds on critical geographic theories to analyze and visualize topological and relational spaces, relevant to topics such as gentrification and segregation. The result is not a geography in which smart technology and algorithms remove the need for human input but rather a rejoinder in line with the recent resurgence of a critical quantitative geography. In short, the result is a geography where social theory and the human intellect play a key role in guiding computational approaches to analyze the largest, most versatile, most and relevant data sets on social space that we have ever had.","Critical Quant Geography.

What has been given limited attention is the degree production within special education (SPED) and education (ED) baccalaureate programs. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), we examined degree production in SPED and ED degree programs by race. We began by analyzing trend data of SPED and ED degrees produced, specifically by race, to provide a foundation for further inquiry as to why the trends exist. Using a random-effects panel regression, we then conducted an exploratory analysis of relations between degrees produced in SPED and ED by race and institutional factors (e.g., cost of attendance and institutional racial demographics) and characteristics (e.g., Carnegie classification and HBCU [historically Black college and university] status), building on the analyses of trend data and providing some more direction for future research. Broadly, we ask: What is the recent history of SPED and ED degree production, and what institutional characteristics relate to
degree production? An examination of this question provides a foundation for further inquiry that could lead to understanding issues in the recruitment of racially/ethnically

In the current educational system, it is unlikely for a student to become a physicist if they do not share the same attitudes about what it means to learn and do physics as those held by most professional physicists. Evidence shows college physics courses and degree programs do not support students in developing these attitudes. Rather physics education filters out students who do not enter college physics courses with these attitudes. To better understand the role of attitudes in the lack of diversity in physics, we investigated the intersecting relationships between racism and sexism in inequities in student attitudes about learning and doing physics using a critical quantitative framework. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine students’ attitudes as measured by the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes database and included 2170 students in 46 calculus-based mechanics courses and 2503 students in 49 algebra-based mechanics courses taught at 18 institutions. Like prior studies, we found that attitudes either did not change or slightly decreased for most groups. Results identified large differences across intersecting race and gender groups representing
educational debts society owes these students. White students, particularly White men in calculus-based courses, tended to have more expertlike attitudes than any other group of students. Instruction that addresses society’s educational debts can help move physics toward an inclusive culture supportive of diverse students and professionals.",,,,,,1,Physical Review Physics Education Research

the literatures on the social determinants of health and environmental justice highlights the importance of the environmental
conditions for health inequalities and sheds light on the institutional mechanisms driving environmental health inequalities.
Employing a critical quantitative methods approach, we use data from an innovative state racism index to argue that systematic racialized inequalities in areas from housing to employment increase outdoor airborne environmental health risks
in neighborhoods. Results of a multilevel analysis in over 65,000 census tracts demonstrate that tracts in states with higher
levels of state-level Black–white gaps report greater environmental health risk exposure to outdoor air pollution. The state
racism index explains four-to-ten percent of county- and state-level variation in carcinogenic risk and noncarcinogenic respiratory system risks from outdoor air toxics. The fndings suggest that the disproportional exposure across communities is
tied to systematic inequalities in environmental regulation and other structural elements such as housing and incarceration.

structural mechanisms that place Black, Indigenous, and other

“dropout” implies a choice made by students to leave school while “pushout” accounts for the various forces that lead to students
leaving school. One factor that contributes to this alarming statistic is that harsh school punishment disproportionately affects
racial and ethnic minority students in urban settings, rather than making school more accessible for them. Using data from the
California Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Data Collection repository, we provide a descriptive analysis of the
school-toprison pipeline in Southern California. This description is based on two innovative critical race methodologies: QuantCrit (quantitative) and Counterstorytelling (qualitative). These methodologies illuminate the experiences of thirty-nine former high
